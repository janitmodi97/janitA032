            This place I visited with my college friend on her request. It was located very close to my house and I didn't even know about it. It was a lazy sunday afternoon and this being more of an open cafe had very little crowd....Thank God!!So as soon as we reached there we ordered the godfather burger. Yes you read it right it was the godfather of all burgers it had 4 patties each of a different meat put one on top of the other. Finishing the ginormous meal felt like a great task at hand but we did...and it was delicous.
            So my final review is if you are foodie and have a giant appetite this is the place for you. The deep fried ores I had here at a later time were also delicious. A bigs thumps!!
            PS: The place is under renovation at the moment but will reopen soon. <br>

            This place I visited twice once with fam second with friends. The first time I had a hearty meal and the second we only focused on deserts. OK so the first time we started off with basic appetizers like the mezze platter, jacket potatoes and cuban cheese cigars. To pour it down we paired it with mock sangrias and kookai which is apparently their speciality(not my fav but worth a try). Now it was time for the entree...we directly jumped to the favourite part of the menu...pizzas!! I ordered a margherita pizza for myself and others split a farmfresh and a quattro formagio(not good) pizza. You honestly can't go wrong with margherita.
            Now it was time for dessert and without doubt we ordered the large chocolate milkshake and boy was it good....
            The second we came only for this large milkshake and jalapeno cheese poppers.
            Final review....great place for vegetarian foodies who want to try different cuisines. Not very pocket friendly but definitely worth it.

                Been here only once but enjoyed it alot. Had a nutella milkshake and macaroni with bacon served in a cone. The place is pocket friendly and needs id to enter after 7:00 pm. Decent ambience...an absolute thumps up.
                The crowd here is good and on the younger side and place is known for frequent celebrity spotings.

                This was a random impromtu plan...so I desperately wanted japanese food and my friend who practically hates raw fish decided to tag along. The first thing we ordered was some sort of roasted chicken with soya sauce for my friend who hated uncooked meat. Then we ordered a scallop sushi...it tasted bomb even my friend tried it.
                Final review... it may seem like an authentic japanese place but is far from it. Decent food but heavy on the pocket. Worth a one time visit.<br>

                Ok so this too was an impromtu plan...tired of eating the usual roti sabji I got from home I decided to visit this place. Since it wasn't preplanned most my friends had their tiffins and were hesitant to go. Finally I convinced one of my friend to acoompany me. So as soon we reached this we ordered a meat platter. It was a cold cut platter which had sausages, bacon and hash browns. Though it was a bit bland but it was well cooked.
                Final review.... definitely worth a visit. The restuarant offers decent buffets and is a nice family place.<br>

                Visited this place twice once at the Khar branch and once at the kemps Corner one. Ordered almost the same thing on both the occasions. When you talk about Gustoso you just can't not talk about the metre long pizza!! Yes this place offers a metre long pizza which can be divided into 4 parts each of a different topping....sounds yum right it??
                To pour it down we ordered sula carbinet shiraz(my personal fav for pizza). I ordered the same thing both times paired with a feta cheese and tomato salad in the latter occasion.
                Final review.....this place is definitely worth a visit but it is quite heavy on the pocket so plan accordingly.

                Ok so this a story I love to tell...it was a usual saturday night drunk out of our minds we were hopping from one place to another hopelessly searching for food at 3am. Luckily we stumbled upon this quaint little restaurant at kalaghoda which is open till 4am and thank god we did...The food out here is yumm and dirt cheap. We ordered cheesy fries and pizzas but that depends upon you cause literally everything here is fabulous.
                Final review....definitely a must visit but word of advice take your car and go or else you will have to stand as there is no seating arrangement
